## Stillness in the snow

Opting for stillness, you tune into the snowy quiet. A distant wolf's howl prompts you to follow, and in a clearing, you encounter a lone wolf. A silent understanding forms, and the wolf becomes an unexpected guide, leading you to a familiar trail on the forest's edge. Grateful, you follow the moonlit path, comforted by the once-ominous silence. What other mysteries await in the winter night? Time will tell as you journey on.
