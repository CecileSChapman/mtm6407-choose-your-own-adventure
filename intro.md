## Chapter 1: The Fading Trail


In the snowy Canadian mountains, you're on a winter hike, surrounded by towering evergreens and chilly air. You feel the frigid temperature bite at your rosy cheeks as you follow an old faded trail. You hear the soft crunch of the snow with each step you take, creating a peaceful melody in the quiet forest.

However, you notice the sky getting darker as the sunlight starts to fade. You try and quicken your pace, but the sky is darkening faster than you can find your way back to your winter cabin. The enchanting silence of the woods becomes eerie as the only sounds are your footsteps and the distant calls of a nocturnal creature.

Lost in this winter wonderland, the confusion grows with each step, the forest now a maze of unfamiliar grounds. Standing at the crossroads of uncertainty, you can't help but feel a chill down your spine. The question echoes in the frigid air: What will you do next?
