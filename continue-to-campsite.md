## Continue to campsite

You are already on the hiking trail in the Canadian cold mountains, and going back home in the dark cold weather may pose to more dangerous and longer than moving on to reach your campsite. You may just move ahead, brave the chilly weather and hope to make it back to your place of refuge - your winter cabin. All sorts of hopes flying through you head - Finding sources you meet on the way to help you survive, hoping to have sufficient strength and motivation despite the darkening surroundings, to carry you all the way to the winter camp, and trusting that some of your campmates will have reached toe camp and start of a campfire to warm you up immediately when you get to the camp. At the least, you hope to find some items to set up a campfire if your freinds are not around.

If your friends are not around, you will gather some wood and stones to make a campfire to warm up. You build up a tent so that you can bring your sleeping kit to sleep and keep you warm during nighttime. You gather poles and ropes to attach with the tent to the ground before the cold wind blows it away. Look to the difference that the cozy, and warm environment in the camp will give you from the chilly, windy and wintery outside mountains should continue to give you the impetuous to move ahead until you reach your camp site.  Also the warm food, that you will eat in your camp should be the encouragement that keeps you going till you get to your campsite.
